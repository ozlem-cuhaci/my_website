<h2>Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing</h2>
<p>I’ll analyze Transport for London bike sharing data to inspect how do the number of bike rentals change between 2015 and 2020. I’ll visualize monthly and weekly changes in the number of rentals through the years.</p>

We can say that lockdown due to Covid-19 has significantly decreased the bike rentals in 2020.</p>
<p>The second plot will look at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals.</p>
<p>I calculated a variable excess rentals = actual rentals - expected rentals for each of the plots. For this calculation, I used the mean of bikes hired. Because we need to know the average number of bike rentals within a month/week between 2015 and 2020, and compare this with the average number of actual bike rentals within a particular month/week.</p>
