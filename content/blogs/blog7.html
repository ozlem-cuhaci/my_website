<h2>General Election 2015 and Brexit 2016</h2>
<p>As you all know Brexit is the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Following a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, 52% of British citizens voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48% voted to remain a member. One year ago in 2015, there was another election, general election of UK where Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UK Independence Party were the canditates. In my analysis, I wanted to investigate how political affiliation translated to Brexit voting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Let&#39;s read the dataframe 
brexit_results &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;brexit_results.csv&quot;))

brexit_results %&gt;% 
#We need to tidy data by gathering all the 2015 election results into party column
pivot_longer(cols= ends_with(&quot;2015&quot;),
                   names_to=&quot;party&quot;,
                   values_to=&quot;party_votes&quot;) %&gt;% 

#We group tidy data by party
ggplot(aes(x= party_votes, y=leave_share, group=party, color=party))+ 
#Make the points more transparent
geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
#Plot best fitted linear line
geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) +
#We color each party according to its official color and change the legend names
scale_color_manual(values=c(&quot;#0087dc&quot;, &quot;#d50000&quot;, &quot;#FDBB30&quot;, &quot;#EFE600&quot;), labels = c(&quot;Conservative&quot;, &quot;Labour&quot;, &quot;Lib Dems&quot;, &quot;UKIP&quot;)) +
#Y-axis limits should be between 20 and 100
ylim(20,100) + 
labs(title=&quot;How political affiliation translated to Brexit Voting&quot;, x=&quot;Party % in the UK 2015 general election&quot;, y=&quot;Leave % in the 2016 Brexit referandum&quot;) + 
theme_minimal() +
#We place legend to the bottom, remove the legend title and draw border for the plot
theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;, legend.title=element_blank(), panel.border = element_rect(colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill=NA)) </code></pre>

<p>For someone who doesn’t know about politics in the UK can easily say, by looking at this plot, that UK Independence party doesn’t want to stay in the UK. As the percentage of UKIP votes increase, leave percentage in the in the Brexit referandum increases. So, UKIP followers voted mostly leave in the Brexit. Furthermore, it seems like Labour party voters didn’t affect the result of the Brexit.</p>
