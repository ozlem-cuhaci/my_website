# Brexit plot

We will use the Brexit results dataframe that we have used in the pre-programme assignement and produce the following plot.

As you all know Brexit is the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Following a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, 52% of British citizens voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48% voted to remain a member. One year ago in 2015, there was another election, general election of UK where Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UK Independence Party were the canditates. In my analysis, I wanted to investigate how political affiliation translated to Brexit voting.

```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}

#Let's read the dataframe 
brexit_results <- read_csv(here::here("data","brexit_results.csv"))

brexit_results %>% 
#We need to tidy data by gathering all the 2015 election results into party column
pivot_longer(cols= ends_with("2015"),
                   names_to="party",
                   values_to="party_votes") %>% 

#We group tidy data by party
ggplot(aes(x= party_votes, y=leave_share, group=party, color=party))+ 
#Make the points more transparent
geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
#Plot best fitted linear line
geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
#We color each party according to its official color and change the legend names
scale_color_manual(values=c("#0087dc", "#d50000", "#FDBB30", "#EFE600"), labels = c("Conservative", "Labour", "Lib Dems", "UKIP")) +
#Y-axis limits should be between 20 and 100
ylim(20,100) + 
labs(title="How political affiliation translated to Brexit Voting", x="Party % in the UK 2015 general election", y="Leave % in the 2016 Brexit referandum") + 
theme_minimal() +
#We place legend to the bottom, remove the legend title and draw border for the plot
theme(legend.position="bottom", legend.title=element_blank(), panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA)) 

        
```
